A scheduling framework that is a generalisation of Timer and TimerTask to allow more flexible scheduling. The framework is very simple -- it consists of two classes and an interface -- and it is easy to learn. A programmer who is used to working with the Java timer framework can pick up the scheduling framework very quickly.
